Research on the fabrication of modified cyanate ester resins/ high modulus poly (p-phenylene-2,6-benzobisoxazole) (HMPBO) fibers wave-transparent composite;
Soluble epoxy-terminated PBO precursor (epoxy-prePBO) was fabricated;
Wave-transparent composite with 7wt% epoxy-prePBO showed satisfactory dielectric constant (e, 2.68) and dielectric loss tangent (tand, 0.0061) values;
Mechanical properties of composites were improved (flexural strength, 658.5 MPa and interlaminar shear strength 48.4 MPa.
