                Dear Apple Hiring Manager,

                
                    <p class="text-base mt-2">I am writing to express my interest in the AI/ML - NLP Engineer position (Ref. 200508826) at Apple. With extensive experience in natural language processing and machine learning, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team. As the Lead Research Engineer II at ALI, I2R, A*Star, I have led the development of a comprehensive LLM integrated pipeline framework, centralizing data pipelines and model management, which aligns well with Apple's need for end-to-end ML solutions. My role involved designing and implementing ML solutions, which directly relates to the responsibilities outlined in the job description.</p>
                
                    <p class="text-base mt-2">Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in Python, Java, and PyTorch, and have developed a strong understanding of NLP techniques, including text representation, semantic extraction, and classification algorithms. I have successfully managed projects such as the Document-level Event Extraction and Multi-turn Dialogue Emotion Analysis, where I improved productivity by up to 4.6 times and enhanced data quality through innovative annotation tools. These experiences demonstrate my capability to handle large-scale datasets and develop effective ML solutions tailored to business needs.</p>
                
                    <p class="text-base mt-2">My experience with large-scale data collection and real-world datasets, coupled with my fluency in Mandarin, equips me to support Apple's initiatives in the Greater China market. I have consistently delivered high-quality results, such as achieving an 86% F1-score in sentiment analysis projects and optimizing annotation processes for enhanced speed and accuracy. This background aligns well with Apple's requirements for a deep understanding of text representation techniques and model evaluation.</p>
                
                    <p class="text-base mt-2">I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my expertise in NLP and machine learning to Apple, contributing to the development of innovative solutions that drive business success. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your team.</p>
